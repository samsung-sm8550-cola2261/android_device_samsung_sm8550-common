         Choices are: OFF, DELETE, TRUNCATE, PERSIST and MEMORY.
         PERSIST may improve performance by reducing how often journal blocks are
         reallocated (compared to truncation) resulting in better data block locality
         and less churn of the storage media.
         The PERSIST mode results in data persisting in the journal beyond the life of

         integrity although there is a small chance that an error might go unnoticed.

    <!-- The database synchronization mode when using Write-Ahead Logging.
         From https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_synchronous:
         WAL mode is safe from corruption with synchronous=NORMAL, and probably DELETE mode is safe
         too on modern filesystems. WAL mode is always consistent with synchronous=NORMAL, but WAL
         mode does lose durability. A transaction committed in WAL mode with
         synchronous=NORMAL might roll back following a power loss or system crash.
         Transactions are durable across application crashes regardless of the synchronous setting
         or journal mode. The synchronous=NORMAL setting is a good choice for most applications
         running in WAL mode.
         Choices are: FULL, NORMAL, OFF. -->
